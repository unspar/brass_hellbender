We're making a drone that can fly around and do stuff

TODO:
Drone Parts- Build
Flight controls- Software?  Hardware?
Brains- AI?  Control Software
Sensors- What do we need?
Flight Control electronics-raspberry pi stuff


Plan-
1.  Order Drone  COMPLETE
2.  Build human flyable drone w/ parts
2.  Replace flight controller with Raspberry Pi. 
3.  Write Flight Control Software
4.  Automate Flight/Fun Stuff
